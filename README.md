# Study App
An app with Pomodoro and to do list with a cute strawberry theme!
It was all coded in HTML, CSS, and JS.
All the pictures used are from Google, none are mine, and all are credited free for personal use and not for any commercial use.
Made for Athena Sleepover, an initiative from Hack Club. And it followed the January challenge.


Home page:
It has the latest times of pomodoro sessions you focused on and a simple to-do list to see your tasks; everything is stored in local storage.

Pomodoro Page:
It has only a simple Pomodoro timer; you could add or subtract 5 minutes from the timer, I didn't put much stuff in, so it would not be a source of distraction.

Settings Page:
You could change the name or profile picture in the home page from there, to make it look just as you like!

There is a random strawberry pattern each time you reload the pages; it is applied to all pages.
